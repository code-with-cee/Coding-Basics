<p align="center">Follow me at @CodingWithCee on tiktok for visual tutorials!</p>

## Before You Start
1. Watch my tiktok video on VSCode
2. Watch my tiktok on Github
3. Install <b>VSCode</b>
4. Install <b>Github Desktop</b>

## Installation & Usage
1. Fork this repo
2. Use Github Desktop or your terminal to clone the repo for a local copy.
3. Write your code in the DIY files. Look at the tiktok video that references each tutorial. Links to the videos are under each tutorial title. Try to refrain from looking at the solution until you've tried it yourself.
4. Get in the practice of committing and pushing your code frequently. Preferably after completing each tutorial.

## Tutorials

### Hello World
> <b>Hello, World</b> is like the ABCs of coding, a rite of passage for every programmer! Join me in prepping your work environment for all that is to come in your journey!
>* <b>DIY:</b> Print <i>Hello, World!</i>, then execute the code. You should see <i>Hello, World!</i> in your console.
>* <b>Solution:</b> Once you've attempted <b>Hello, World</b> yourself, check the solution to make sure you've completed it correctly.

### Variables & Data Types
> <b>Variables</b> are a named container that are used to represent a value of a specific <b>Data Type</b>.
>* <b>DIY:</b> Declare variables with meaningful names that introduces you.
>* <b>Solution:</b> Once you've attemted the <b>Variables & Data Types</b> exercise, refer to the solution to learn a but about me.

### Operators & Control Flow
> <b>Operators</b> are a way to compare or aggregate your data. <b>Control Flow</b> allows you to add logic into your program for a desired outcome.
>* <b>DIY:</b> Declare variables with meaningful names that introduces a family member. Use your introduction variables from the <b>Variables & Data Types</b> exercise to compare and aggregate the values. Next, use your intro variables and/or your family member's intro variables to practice <b>Control Flow</b>.
>* <b>Solution:</b> Once you've attempted the <b>Operators & Control Flow</b> exercise, refer to the solution to see how I compare to my older sister.

### Functions
> <b>Functions</b> are a section of code that performs a specific task.
>* <b>DIY:</b> Create a function that compares the ages of you and your family member then returns who's older. Use variables from the two previous exercises.
>* <b>Solution:</b> Once you've attempted the <b>Functions</b> exercise, refer to the solution to see who's older between my sister and I.

### Arrays and Objects
> <b>Arrays</b> are a collection of items of the same data type. <b>Objects</b> are a collection of properties that include a <i>key</i> and <i>value</i>.
>* <b>DIY: Part 1</b> Create an array of your family's ages and an array of your family's names. Create an object mapping each family member's name to their age. Create a function that finds the youngest family member and prints their name and age.
>* <b>DIY: Part 2</b> Create a function that adds a new family member's name to your family array and their age in the family's ages array. In the same function, add the new family member's name and age to the family object.
>* <b>Solution:</b> Once you've attempted the <b>Arrays and Objects</b> exercise, refer to the solution to see who's the youngest in my family.
